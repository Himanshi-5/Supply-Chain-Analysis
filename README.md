# Supply-Chain-Analysis
I did a supply chain project using SQL where I checked revenue, suppliers, shipping, and customer details

**Supply Chain Analysis using SQL**
Overview This project analyzes the supply chain operations of a Fashion & Beauty startup, using SQL. The dataset includes product, supplier, shipping, manufacturing, and customer details. The main goal was to gain insights into revenue, supplier performance, shipping efficiency, and overall supply chain effectiveness.

**Tools & Skills**

-> SQL (PostgreSQL)

-> Joins, Aggregate Functions

-> Business Analytics with SQL

**Key Analysis Performed**

1)Total revenue and average price by product type.

2)Revenue by customer demographics.

3)Large orders with long lead times.

4)Most cost-efficient shipping carriers.

5)Average shipping time by supplier.

6)City with the fastest delivery.

7)Supplier with the highest production volume.

8)Transport modes and defect rate analysis.

9)Cost analysis by shipping routes.

**Insights**

1)Skincare is the top revenue generator (â‚¹2,41,628).

2)Cosmetics have the highest price but lower sales.

3)Unknown customers contribute the most revenue.

4)Carrier B is the most cost-efficient shipping option.

5)Supplier 3 delivers the fastest (5.20 days), while Supplier 5 is the slowest (6.22 days).
